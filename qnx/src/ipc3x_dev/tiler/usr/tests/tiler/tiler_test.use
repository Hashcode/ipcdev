Parametric memmgr test

Syntax:
  tiler_test [<operations>]

  Parametric memmgr test.  This is similar to the star test
  except the operations are read from the command line:

  [#=]a:w*h*bits[,w*h*bits...] allocates a list of blocks as
  buffer # (it frees any previously allocated/mapped buffer
  f:# frees a buffer
