 * <li>Free such allocated blocks
 * <li>Map 1D buffers into tiler space
 * <li>Unmap 1D buffers from tiler space

 *
 * The allocator distinguishes between:
 * <ul>
 * <li>1D and 2D blocks
 * <li>2D blocks allocated by MemAlloc are non-cacheable.  All
 * other blocks are cacheable (e.g. 1D blocks).  Preallocated
 * may or may not be cacheable, depending on how they've been
 * allocated, but are assumed to be cacheable.
 * <li>buffers (an ordered collection of one or more blocks
 * mapped consecutively)

 *
 * The allocator tracks each buffer based on (addr, size).
 *
 * Also, via the tiler manager, it tracks each block.  The tiler
 * manager itself also tracks each buffer.
