 *  @brief      Attach to remote processor
 *
 *  @note       This function is currently only supported on SYS/BIOS.
 *
 *  This function synchronizes with the remote processor, typically via
 *  shared memory.  Both processors must call this function to attach to each
 *  other.  Ipc_start() must be called before calling Ipc_attach().
 *  A processor must attach to the owner of SharedRegion zero before
 *  it can successfully attach to another processor.  Attempting to
 *  attach to another processor first returns #Ipc_E_FAIL.
 *
 *  This function opens the default GateMP and SharedRegion zero heap.
 *  The Notify, NameServerRemoteNotify, and MessageQ transport
 *  instances are created for communicating with the specified remote
 *  processor in SharedRegion zero heap.  The user's Ipc attach function
 *  is called.
 *
 *  On SYS/BIOS, this function should be called within a 'while' loop
 *  within a Task.  A Task_sleep() or Task_yield() should be called
 *  within the loop to allow other threads in the system to execute.
 *  This function needs to be called in a loop because the remote
 *  processor may not be in a ready state.
 *
 *  @note For SYS/BIOS, if the config parameter Ipc.procSync is set to
 *  Ipc.ProcSync_ALL, there is no need to call this function as it is
 *  internally called by Ipc_start().
 *
 *  @code
 *  while (Ipc_attach(remoteProcId) < 0) {
 *      Task_sleep(1);
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *

 *  @brief      Detach from the remote processor
 *
 *  @note       This function is currently only supported on SYS/BIOS.
 *
 *  A processor must detach from all other processors before it can
 *  successfully detach from the owner of SharedRegion zero.  Attempting to
 *  detach from the owner of SharedRegion zero first returns #Ipc_E_FAIL.
 *
 *  If a processor successfully attached to a remote processor 'N' times,
 *  it must call Ipc_detach 'N' times to be completely detached.
 *  Ipc_detach returns #Ipc_S_BUSY for the first 'N - 1' times its called.
 *  Ipc_detach returns #Ipc_S_SUCCESS, if successful, on the 'N' time its
 *  called.  If called on a remote processor that is detached, #Ipc_S_SUCCESS
 *  is returned.
 *
 *  This function should be called within a loop to make sure the processor
 *  successfully detached from the remote processor.
 *  If called from the processor with the bigger procId, this function closes
 *  the instances created for communicating with the specified remote processor.
 *  If called from the processor with the smaller procId, this function returns
 *  Ipc_E_NOTREADY while the processor with the bigger procId has not finished
 *  detaching.  Once the processor with the bigger procId is finished detaching,
 *  this function deletes the instances created for communicating with the
 *  specified remote processor.
 *
 *  For SYS/BIOS, this function should be called within a 'while' loop in a Task
 *  because the slave may have to wait for the master to detach.  Furthermore,
 *  a Task_sleep() or Task_yield() should be called within the same 'while'
 *  loop to allow other threads in the system to execute.

 *  Ipc_writeConfig() and Ipc_readConfig() are used to pass
 *  configuration information from one core to another.  This 'information'
 *  is passed via a pointer to shared memory with a given size and is
 *  identified via a unique tag.  A typical use case of this API would be
 *  passing configuration information at startup-time.  For example, if
 *  MessageQ is used, this information might include the queue name, message
 *  heap sizes, etc.
 *
 *  For Ipc_writeConfig(), if 'NULL' is passed in for the cfg parameter,
 *  it attempts to free the shared memory that is allocated by a previous
 *  Ipc_writeConfig() call. The @c remoteProcId, @c tag, and @c size must match
 *  the previous Ipc_writeConfig() call.
 *
 *  Ipc_writeConfig() writes into SharedRegion 0 (SR0) and uses
 *  @c tag to uniquely identify the structure (@c cfg) and @c size written
 *  into SR0 which both sides must agree on.
