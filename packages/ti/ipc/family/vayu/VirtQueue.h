 *
 *  @brief      Virtio Queue interface for BIOS
 *
 *  Differences between BIOS version and Linux kernel (include/linux/virtio.h):
 *  - Renamed module from virtio.h to VirtQueue.h to match the API prefixes;
 *  - BIOS (XDC) types and CamelCasing used;
 *  - virtio_device concept removed (i.e, assumes no containing device);
 *  - removed scatterlist;
 *  - VirtQueues are created statically here, so just added a VirtQueue_init()
 *    fxn to take the place of the Virtio vring_new_virtqueue() API;
 *  - The notify function is implicit in the implementation, and not provided
 *    by the client, as it is in Linux virtio.
 *  - Broke into APIs to add/get used and avail buffers, as the API is
 *    assymmetric.
 *
 *  Usage:
 *     This IPC only works between one processor designated as the Host (Linux)
 *     and one or more Slave processors (BIOS).
 *
 *     For any Host/Slave pair, there are 2 VirtQueues (aka Vrings);
 *     Only the Host adds new buffers to the avail list of a vring;
 *     Available buffers can be empty or full, depending on direction;
 *     Used buffer means "processed" (emptied or filled);
 *
 *  Host:
 *    - To send buffer to the slave processor:
 *          add_avail_buf(slave_virtqueue);
 *          kick(slave_virtqueue);
 *          get_used_buf(slave_virtqueue);
 *    - To receive buffer from slave processor:
 *          add_avail_buf(host_virtqueue);
 *          kick(host_virtqueue);
 *          get_used_buf(host_virtqueue);
 *
 *  Slave:
 *    - To send buffer to the host:
 *          get_avail_buf(host_virtqueue);
 *          add_used_buf(host_virtqueue);
 *          kick(host_virtqueue);
 *    - To receive buffer from the host:
 *          get_avail_buf(slave_virtqueue);
 *          add_used_buf(slave_virtqueue);
 *          kick(slave_virtqueue);
 *
 *  All VirtQueue operations can be called in any context.
 *
 *  The virtio header should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/ipc/rpmsg/VirtQueue.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
