 *
 *  @brief      NameServer Manager
 *
 *  The NameServer module manages local name/value pairs that
 *  enables an application and other modules to store and
 *  retrieve values based on a name. The module supports different
 *  lengths of values. The NameServer_add() and NameServer_get()
 *  functions are for variable length values. The NameServer_addUInt32() and
 *  NameServer_getUInt32() functions are optimized for UInt32 variables
 *  and constants.
 *
 *  The NameServer module maintains thread-safety for the APIs. However,
 *  the NameServer APIs cannot be called from an interrupt (i.e. Hwi) context.
 *  However, it is safe to use the APIs in Swi's and Tasks.
 *
 *  Each NameServer instance manages a different name/value table.
 *  This allows each table to be customized to meet the requirements
 *  of user:
 *  @li <b>Size differences:</b> one table could allow long values
 *  (e.g. > 32 bits) while another table could be used to store integers.
 *  This customization enables better memory usage.
 *  @li <b>Performance:</b> improves search time when retrieving
 *  a name/value pair.
 *  @li <b>Relax name uniqueness:</b> names in a specific table must
 *  be unique, but the same name can be used in different tables.
 *
 *  When adding a name/value pair, the name and value are copied into
 *  internal buffers in NameServer. To minimize runtime memory allocation
 *  these buffers can be allocated at creation time.
 *
 *  NameServer maintains the name/values table in local memory (e.g.
 *  not shared memory). However the NameServer module can be
 *  used in a multiprocessor system.
 *
 *  The NameServer module uses the MultiProc module for
 *  identifying the different processors. Which remote processors and
 *  the order they are queried is determined by the procId array in the
 *  NameServer_get() function.
 *
 *  Currently there is no endian or wordsize conversion performed by the
 *  NameServer module. Also there is no asynchronous support at this time.
 *
 *  The NameServer header should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/ipc/NameServer.h>
 *  @endcode
