 *  ======== MessageQ ========
 *  Message-passing with queuing
 *
 *  The MessageQ module supports the structured sending and receiving of
 *  variable length messages. This module can be used for homogeneous
 *  (DSP to DSP)  or heterogeneous (Arm to DSP) multi-processor messaging.
 *
 *  MessageQ provides more sophisticated messaging than other modules. It is
 *  typically used for complex situations such as multi-processor messaging.
 *
 *  The following are key features of the MessageQ module:
 *  @p(blist)
 *  -Writers and readers can be relocated to another processor with no
 *   runtime code changes.
 *  -Timeouts are allowed when receiving messages.
 *  -Readers can determine the writer and reply back.
 *  -Receiving a message is deterministic when the timeout is zero.
 *  -Messages can reside on any message queue.
 *  -Supports zero-copy transfers.
 *  -Can send and receive from any type of thread.
 *  -Notification mechanism is specified by application.
 *  -Allows QoS (quality of service) on message buffer pools. For example,
 *   using specific buffer pools for specific message queues.
 *  @p
 *
 *  Messages are sent and received by being placed on and removed from a
 *  message queue. A reader is a thread that gets (reads) messages from a
 *  message queue. A writer is a thread that puts (writes) a message to a
 *  message queue. Each message queue has one reader and can have many writers.
 *  A thread may read from or write to multiple message queues.
 *
 *  Conceptually, the reader thread owns a message queue. The reader thread
 *  creates a message queue. The writer threads open a created message queue
 *  to get access to them.
 *
 *  Message queues are identified by a system-wide unique name. Internally,
 *  MessageQ uses the {@link ti.sdo.utils.NameServer} module for managing
 *  these names. The names are used for opening a message queue.
 *
 *  Messages must be allocated from the MessageQ module. Once a message is
 *  allocated, it can be sent to any message queue. Once a message is sent, the
 *  writer loses ownership of the message and should not attempt to modify the
 *  message. Once the reader receives the message, it owns the message. It
 *  may either free the message or re-use the message.
 *
 *  Messages in a message queue can be of variable length. The only
 *  requirement is that the first field in the definition of a message must be a
 *  {@link #MsgHeader} structure. For example:
 *  @p(code)
 *  typedef struct MyMsg {
 *      MessageQ_MsgHeader header;
 *      ...
 *  } MyMsg;
 *  @p
 *
 *  The MessageQ API uses the MessageQ_MsgHeader internally. Your application
 *  should not modify or directly access the fields in the MessageQ_MsgHeader.
 *
 *  All messages sent via the MessageQ module must be allocated from a
 *  {@link xdc.runtime.IHeap} implementation. The heap can also be used for
 *  other memory allocation not related to MessageQ.
 *
 *  An application can use multiple heaps. The purpose of having multiple
 *  heaps is to allow an application to regulate its message usage. For
 *  example, an application can allocate critical messages from one heap of fast
 *  on-chip memory and non-critical messages from another heap of slower
 *  external memory.
 *
 *  The {@link #registerHeap} and {@link #registerHeapMeta} are APIs used to
 *  assign a MessageQ heapId to a heap. When allocating a message, the heapId
 *  is used, not the heap handle. This heapId is actually placed into the
 *  message (part of the {@link #MsgHeader}). Care must be taken when assigning
 *  heapIds. Refer to the {@link #registerHeap} and {@link #registerHeapMeta}
 *  descriptions for more details.
 *
 *  MessageQ also supports the usage of messages that are not allocated via the
 *  {@link #alloc} function. Please refer to the {@link #staticMsgInit}
 *  function description for more details.
 *
 *  MessageQ supports reads/writes of different thread models. This is
 *  accomplished by having the creator of the message queue specify a
 *  {@link xdc.runtime.knl.ISync#Object} via the {@link #synchronizer}
 *  configuration parameter. The {@link xdc.runtime.knl.ISync#signal}
 *  portion of the ISync instance is called whenever the {@link #put}
 *  is called. The {@link xdc.runtime.knl.ISync#wait} portion is
 *  called in the {@link #get} if and only if there are no messages.
 *
 *  Since ISyncs are binary, the reader must drain the message queue of all
 *  messages before waiting for another signal. For example, if the reader
 *  was a SYSBIOS Swi, the {@link xdc.runtime.knl.ISync} instance
 *  could be a SyncSwi. If a {@link #put} was called, the Swi_post() would
 *  be called. The Swi would run and it must call {@link #get} until no
 *  messages are returned.
 *
 *  In a multiple processor system, MessageQ communicates to other
 *  processors via {@link ti.sdo.ipc.interfaces.IMessageQTransport} instances.
 *  MessageQ supports a high priority and a normal priority transport between
 *  any two processors. The IMessageQTransport instances are created via the
 *  {@link #SetupTransportProxy}. The instances are responsible for
 *  registering themselves with MessageQ. This is accomplished via the
 * {@link #registerTransport} function.
