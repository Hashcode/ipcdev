     *  IPC library selection options
     *
     *  This enumeration defines all the IPC library types provided
     *  by the product. You can select the library type by setting
     *  the {@link #libType Build.libType} configuration parameter.
     *
     *  @field(LibType_Instrumented) The library supplied is prebuilt
     *  with logging and assertions enabled.
     *
     *  @field(LibType_NonInstrumented) The library supplied is prebuilt
     *  with logging and assertions disabled.
     *
     *  @field(LibType_Custom) This option builds the IPC library from
     *  sources using the options specified by {@link #customCCOpts}.
     *  Only the modules and APIs that your application uses are
     *  contained in the resulting executable. Program optimization is
     *  performed to reduce the size of the executable and improve
     *  performance. Enough debug information is retained to allow you
     *  to step through the application code in CCS and locate global
     *  variables.
     *
     *  @field(LibType_Debug) This option is similar to the LibType_Custom
     *  option in that it builds the IPC library from sources and omits
     *  modules and APIs that your code does not use. However, no program
     *  optimization is performed. The resulting executable is fully
     *  debuggable, and you can step into IPC code. The tradeoff is that
     *  the executable is larger and runs slower than builds that use the
     *  LibType_Custom option.
     *
     *  @field(LibType_PkgLib) This option uses the individual libraries
     *  built by each package of the IPC product. These libraries are
     *  not shipped. You must build the product to generate the package
     *  libraries. See the IPC Install Guides (links in the Release
     *  Note) for details on building the IPC product.

     *  IPC sources.
     *
     *  In addition to the options specified by `Build.customCCOpts`,
     *  several `-D` and `-I` options are also passed to the compiler.
     *  The options specified by `Build.customCCOpts` preceed the `-D`
     *  and `-I` options passed to the compiler on the command line.

     *  When {@link #libType Build.libType} is set to
     *  {@link #LibType_Debug Build_LibType_Debug}, `Build.customCCOpts`

     *  the target specified by your configuration, includes runtime
     *  model options (such as endianess) that must be the same for all
     *  sources built and linked into your application. You must not

     *  specified by the default value of `Build.customCCOpts`.
