 *  ======== MultiProc ========
 *  Processor Id Module Manager
 *
 *  Many IPC modules require identifying processors in a
 *  multi-processor environment. The MultiProc module centralizes
 *  processor id management into one module.  Since this configuration
 *  is almost always universally required, most IPC applications
 *  require supplying configuration of this module.
 *
 *  Each processor in the MultiProc module may be uniquely identified by
 *  either a name string or an integer ranging from 0 to MAXPROCESSORS - 1.
 *  Configuration is supplied using the {@link #setConfig} meta function,
 *  the {@link #numProcessors} and {@link #baseIdOfCluster}.
 *
 *  The setConfig function tells the MultiProc module:
 *  @p(blist)
 *      - The specific processor for which the application is being built
 *      - The number of processors in the cluster
 *  @p
 *
 *  A cluster is a set of processors within a system which share some share
 *  shared memory and supports notifications. Typically most systems contain
 *  one cluster.  When there are multiple clusters in the system, the
 *  {@link #numProcessors} and {@link #baseIdOfCluster} configuration
 *  paramaters are required to be set before calling {@link #setConfig}
 *
 *  For examle in a system with 2 C6678 devices [each C6678 contains 8
 *  homogeneuous cores].  For first C6678 device:
 *  @p(code)
 *  var MultiProc = xdc.useModule('ti.sdo.utils.MultiProc');
 *  MultiProc.baseIdOfCluster = 0;
 *  MultiProc.numProcessors = 16;
 *  MultiProc.setConfig(null, ["CORE0", "CORE1", "CORE2", "CORE3",
 *                             "CORE4", "CORE5", "CORE6", "CORE7"]);
 *  @p
 *
 *  For second C6678 device:
 *  @p(code)
 *  var MultiProc = xdc.useModule('ti.sdo.utils.MultiProc');
 *  MultiProc.baseIdOfCluster = 8;
 *  MultiProc.numProcessors = 16;
 *  MultiProc.setConfig(null, ["CORE0", "CORE1", "CORE2", "CORE3",
 *                             "CORE4", "CORE5", "CORE6", "CORE7"]);
 *  @p
 *
 *  Using the information supplied using the {@link #setConfig} meta function
 *  and the {@link #baseIdOfCluster} module configuration, the processor IDs
 *  are internally set.  Please refer to the documentation for
 *  {@link #setConfig} and {@link #baseIdOfCluster} for more details.
 *
 *  At runtime, the {@link #getId} call returns the MultiProc id of those
 *  processors within its cluster. At config-time, the {@link #getIdMeta}
 *  call returns the the same value.

     *  MultiProc module to identify:
     *  @p(blist)
     *      - Which is the local processor
     *      - Which processors are being used
     *      - Which processors can synchronize
     *  @p
     *  The second of these two pieces of information is supplied via the
     *  nameList argument.  The nameList is a non-empty set of distinct
     *  processors valid for the particular device.  For a list of valid
     *  processor names for a given device, please refer to the :
     *  {@link ./../ipc/family/doc-files/procNames.html Table of
     *   Valid Names for Each Device}.
     *
     *  The local processor is identified by using a single name from
     *  nameList.  A MultiProc id is internally set to the index of
     *  'name' in the supplied 'nameList'.  I.e. in the example:
     *
     *  @p(code)
     *  MultiProc.setConfig("DSP", ["HOST", "DSP", "OTHERCORE"]);
     *  @p
     *
     *  The processors, "HOST", "DSP" and "OTHERCORE" get assigned MultiProc
     *  IDs 0, 1, and 2, respectively.  The local processor, "DSP" is assigned
     *  an ID of '1'.
     *
     *  If the local processor is not known at static time, it is possible to
     *  supply a null name. MultiProc will set the local id to
     *  {@link #INVALIDID} until it is set at runtime using
     *  MultiProc_setLocalId.
     *
     *  @param(name)        MultiProc name for the local processor
     *  @param(nameList)    Array of all processors used by the application
