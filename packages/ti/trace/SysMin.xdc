 *  ======== SysMin ========
 *
 *  Minimal implementation of `{@link ISystemSupport}`.
 *
 *  This implementation provides a fully functional implementation of
 *  all methods specified by `ISystemSupport`.
 *
 *  The module maintains an internal buffer (with a configurable size)
 *  that stores on the "output". When full, the data is over-written.  When
 *  `System_flush()` is called the characters in the internal buffer are
 *  "output" using the user configuratble `{@link #outputFxn}`.
 *
 *  As with all `ISystemSupport` modules, this module is the back-end for the
 *  `{@link System}` module; application code does not directly call these
 *  functions.
