 *
 *  @brief      Shared memory manager and address translator.
 *
 *  The SharedRegion module is designed to be used in a multi-processor
 *  environment in which memory regions are shared and accessed
 *  across different processors. The module itself does not use any shared
 *  memory, because all module state is stored locally.  SharedRegion
 *  APIs use the system gate for thread protection.
 *
 *  This module creates and stores a local shared memory region table.  The
 *  table contains the processor's view for every shared region in the system.
 *  The table must not contain any overlapping regions.  Each processor's
 *  view of a particular shared memory region is determined by the region id.
 *  In cases where a processor cannot access a certain shared memory region,
 *  that shared memory region should be left invalid for that processor.
 *  Note:  The number of entries must be the same on all processors.
 *
 *  Each shared region contains the following:
 *  @li @b base - The base address
 *  @li @b len - The length
 *  @li @b name - The name of the region
 *  @li @b isValid - Whether the region is valid
 *  @li @b ownerProcId - The id of the processor which owns the region
 *  @li @b cacheEnable - Whether the region is cacheable
 *  @li @b cacheLineSize - The cache line size
 *  @li @b createHeap - Whether a heap is created for the region.
 *
 *  A region is added using the SharedRegion_setEntry() API.
 *  The length of a region must be the same across all processors.
 *  The owner of the region can be specified.  If specified, the owner
 *  manages the shared region.  It creates a HeapMemMP instance which spans
 *  the full size of the region.  The other processors open the same HeapMemMP
 *  instance.
 *
 *  Note: Prior to calling Ipc_start(), If a SharedRegion's 'isValid'
 *  is true and 'createHeap' is true then the owner of the SharedRegion
 *  must be the same as the owner of SharedRegion 0.
 *
 *  After a shared region is valid, SharedRegion APIs can be used to convert
 *  pointers between the local processor's address space and the SharedRegion-
 *  pointer (SRPtr) address space.  These APIs include
 *  SharedRegion_getId(), SharedRegion_getSRPtr() and SharedRegion_getPtr().
 *  An example is shown below:
 *
 *  @code
 *  SharedRegion_SRPtr srptr;
 *  Ptr     addr;
 *  UInt16  id;
 *
 *  // to get the id of the local address if id is not already known.
 *  id = SharedRegion_getId(addr);
 *
 *  // to get the shared region pointer for the local address
 *  srptr = SharedRegion_getSRPtr(addr, id);
 *
 *  // to get the local address from the shared region pointer
 *  addr = SharedRegion_getPtr(srptr);
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  The SharedRegion header should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/ipc/SharedRegion.h>
 *  @endcode
