 *
 *  @brief      Notification manager for IPC
 *
 *  The Notify module manages the multiplexing/demultiplexing of software
 *  interrupts over hardware interrupts.  In order to receive notifications,
 *  a processor registers one or more callback functions to an eventId
 *  using Notify_registerEvent().  The Notify_registerEvent()
 *  call (like most other Notify APIs) uses a MultiProc id and
 *  line id to target a specific interrupt line to/from a specific processor
 *  on a device.  The Notify_eventAvailable() API may be used to query whether
 *  an event id is availble for use before registration.
 *
 *  Once an event has been registered, a remote processor may send an event
 *  using the Notify_sendEvent() call.  If the event and the interrupt line
 *  are both enabled, all callback functions registered to the event will
 *  be called sequentially.
 *
 *  A specific event may be disabled or enabled using the Notify_disableEvent()
 *  and Notify_enableEvent() calls.  An entire interrupt line may be disabled
 *  or restored using the Notify_disable() or Notify_restore() calls.
 *  Notify_disable() does not alter the state of individual events.
 *  Instead, it just disables the ability of the Notify module to receive
 *  events on the interrupt line.
 *
 *  Notify APIs should never be called within an Hwi context.  All API calls
 *  should be made within main(), a Task or a Swi with the exception of
 *  Notify_sendEvent() which may also be called within a Hwi.
 *
 *  "Loopback" functionality allows Notifications to be registered
 *  and sent locally.  This is accomplished by supplying our own MultiProc id
 *  to Notify APIs. Line id #0 is always used for local notifications.  It is
 *  important to be aware of some subtle (but important) differences between
 *  remote and local notifications:
 *
 *      - Loopback callback functions will execute in the same thread in which
 *        Notify_sendEvent() is called.  This is in contrast to callback
 *        functions that are called due to another processor's sent
 *        notification- these 'remote' callback functions will execute in an
 *        ISR context.
 *
 *      - Loopback callback functions will execute with interrupts disabled
 *
 *      - Disabling the local interrupt line will cause all notifications that
 *        are sent to the local processor to be lost.  By contrast, a
 *        notification sent to an enabled event on a remote processor that has
 *        called Notify_disable() results in a pending notifications until the
 *        disabled processor has called Notify_restore().
 *
 *      - Local notifications do not support events of different priorities.
 *        By contrast, Notify driver implementations may correlate event ids
 *        with varying priorities.
 *
 *  In order to use any Notify APIs on DSP/BIOS, IPC/SysLink must first be
 *  started.  This will internally call Notify_attach() which sets up
 *  all necessary Notify drivers, shared memory and interprocessor interrupts.
 *  It is possible for a user application to call Notify_attach() directly
 *  (before Ipc_attach() or Ipc_start()) if notifications must be set up prior
 *  to runtime SharedRegion initialization. Refer to the documentation for
 *  Notify_attach() for more information.
 *
 *  The Notify header should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/ipc/Notify.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  @version  0.00.01

 *
 *  On the destination processor, the callback functions registered

 *  will spin if @c waitClear is TRUE until the FIFO has enough room to accept
